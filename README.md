# Mood Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict daily mood variations based on calendar events. By analyzing personal calendar data, the project seeks to uncover patterns and insights that could predict mood fluctuations, leveraging both quantitative and qualitative aspects of daily schedules.

## Data Explanation

### Overview of the Data
The primary dataset comprises personal calendar entries from Google Calendar, covering academic, personal, and social engagements from June 2021 to March 2024. Each row represents an event with features such as date, start time, end time, summary, number of attendees, status, and more.

### Rationale for Data Selection
The hypothesis is that the nature and density of daily activities impact mood. This dataset offers a holistic view of routine and its potential effects on mood across different days and segments.

### Data Acquisition
The data was obtained using Google Takeout, exporting calendar events from the most active email account.

### Data Sampling
The dataset includes events from June 29, 2021, to March 21, 2024. Events with missing critical information were excluded.

### Ethical Considerations
The data is personal but not private, adhering to ethical guidelines by excluding sensitive or confidential information.

## Data Ingestion and Transformation

### Setting Up the Environment
Necessary Python packages are installed using pip (`icalendar` and `pandas`).

### Importing Libraries
Libraries such as `icalendar`, `pandas`, `datetime`, and `numpy` are imported to handle the data.

### Extracting Event Properties
Functions are defined to safely extract properties from calendar events.

### Loading and Parsing the Calendar Data
The .ics file is parsed, and event details are extracted and stored in a list.

### Transforming Data into a Pandas DataFrame
The list of event dictionaries is converted into a pandas DataFrame for analysis and manipulation.

## Data Cleaning, Pre-Processing, and Exploration

### Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing
- **Cleaning Steps**: Removing incomplete events and duplicates.
- **Pre-Processing Steps**: Creating time-related columns, handling missing values, and final dataset preparation.
- **Feature Engineering Steps**: Adding date and time features, hourly features, and aggregating daily summaries.

### Labeling the Daily Summary Dataset
Each day is labeled with a mood category (Busy, Productive, Relaxed, Overwhelmed) based on the nature and scheduling of events.

### Exploratory Analysis
Visualizations such as bar charts, mood distribution by day of the week, and mood transition matrices are created to understand patterns.

## Task Discussion and Data Splitting for Model Training

### Task Discussion
The project transitions from a multi-class to a binary classification system, focusing on predicting broadly positive or negative days.

### Data Splitting Strategy
The data is split into training, validation, and test sets for model training.

## Model Selection and Construction

### First Pipeline Recap
Initial model construction and performance are reviewed.

### Transitioning to the Second Pipeline
The second pipeline introduces new models and enhancements.

### Models
- **Binary Logistic Regression**
- **XGBoost**
- **Support Vector Machine**

## Models’ Training, Cross-Validation, and Hyperparameters’ Tuning

### Model Training
Models are trained, cross-validated, and tuned for optimal performance.

## Predictions for Out of Sample Data and Performance Evaluation for Models

### Predictions and Evaluation
Models are evaluated using out-of-sample data, with performance metrics compared across models.

## Visualization, Discussion, and Comparison of Conclusions

### Visualizations
Performance metrics, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves are presented.

### Discussion of Conclusions
The findings from the analysis are discussed and compared.

## Extension for the Final Pipeline - Time Series Analysis

### Time Series Analysis
Extended models such as Time Series Forest, LSTM, and GRU are introduced for time series analysis.

## Discussion of Conclusions

### Key Findings
The project’s key findings and conclusions are summarized.

## Executive Summary
